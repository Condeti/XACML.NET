					<P>The idea of this project was to implement the <A href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xacml" target="_blank">
							XACML</A> specification released by <A href="http://www.oasis-open.org/home/index.php" target="_blank">
							Oasis</A> in purely .Net code (C#) which can be used by anyone in the .Net 
						developer comunity. XACML.NET is under the Mozilla license MPL 1.1 so any 
						software under a license compatible with MPL can use this code.
					</P>
					<P>XACML is a specification that defines an access control mechanism based on Xml 
						documents. The specification defines 3 basic documents: <B>Policy</B> (description 
						of the permissions), <B>Request</B> (a request for some <I>Subject</I> over 
						some <I>Resource</I> to perform an <I>Action</I>), and a <B>Response</B> (the 
						results of applying the policy to the Request document). This implementation 
						allows loading policies and requests from its Xml representation, and perform 
						an evaluation aplying the policy. This implementation contains 4 main 
						assemblies:
					</P>
					<UL>
						<LI>
							<I>Core</I>. The main implementation code, this assembly contains a set of 
						classes which are responsible for loading the Policies and Requests and 
						generating a Response resulting from the evaluation of the Request against a 
						Policy. In order to implement a PDP this assembly must be referenced and used.
						<LI>
							<I>xacmlTest</I>. This is a console based evaluation tool that can be used 
						to perform an evaluation over an existing policy and request and will print in 
						the console the result document.
						<LI>
							<I>Control center</I>. A GUI tool used to create and edit policies and 
						requests.
						<LI>
							<I>TestHarness</I>. A set of NUnit tests used to execute all the 
							ConformanceTests provided with the specification.
						</LI>
					</UL>
					<P>Specification conformance: This code implements the 100% XACML 1.0 except the 
						following differences:
					</P>
					<UL>
						<LI>
							regexp-string-match. Since this function is defined for XPath 2.0 and .Net 
							implemnts XPath 1.0 not all the regular expression syntax is supported, 
							specifically <I>Reluctant quantifiers</I>
						are not suported, all the other differences between XSD regular expressions are 
						supported.
						<LI>
							The specification is not very clear about the current node for the XPath 
							expressions and the ConformanceTests are also inconsistent, so a decission was 
							taked for this implementation.
						</LI>
					</UL>
					<P>XACML 1.1 is still in draft but this implementation supports the new (ordered) 
						policy and rule combining algorithms and also makes the assumptions for the 
						XPath expressions return values.
					</P>
					<P>There are also optional features in the specification and this implementation 
						supports the following ones:
					</P>
					<UL>
						<LI>
						Obligations
						<LI>
							<I>Extensible type system</I>. Any data type that is not defined in the 
						specification can be used in the AttributeValues, and new functions can be 
						created supporting those data types, the basic evaluation engine will allow 
						extended data types and there is an API to create the new data types.
						<LI>
							<I>Extensible functions</I>. Functions can be created in external 
						assemblies and added to the evaluation engine in the configuration file.
						<LI>
							<I>Extensible algorithms</I>. Policy combining algorith and Rule combining 
						algorithm can be created in external assemblies and added to the evaluation 
						engine in the configuration class.
						<LI>
							<I>Policy repositories</I>. The specification defines 2 types of policy 
						repositories: Id based and Target based. The first one is a list of policy 
						documents based on the Id of the policy or policy set reference. In the second 
						type the policy or policy set is loaded depending on the Request document 
						contents, all the policies in the repository will be evaluated to determine 
						which one matches the request contents.
						<LI>
							<I>Attribute repositories</I>. External attribute repositories can be created 
							and attributes can be defined in the configuration file or using a class that 
							populates the attribute contents from an external resource.
						</LI>
